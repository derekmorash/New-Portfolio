One of my projects in school was to work in a team with a client to build a site based on the clients needs. The assignment took place over the course of a semester and it was graded more on documentation and teamwork rather than the actual site itself. The goal was to work closely with the client to be able to meet their needs, while documenting our requirements and development process.

Our client was the organizer for the NSCC Robotics competitions. There's a competition for middle school, the First Lego League, and a competition for high school, the MATE underwater robotics. View the completed (unofficial) site [here](http://derekmorash.com/nsccrobo/index.php).

Throughout the course of the semester we would meet with our professor to give progress updates to make sure we're on track with the project. We had a tentative schedule for when things like documents and development progress updates were needed to be completed. Below are some of the requirements we had to deliver throughout the development process.

### Needs Assessment
Before any design or development started we met with the client to talk and get to know more about their organization and what they're trying to accomplish. We had a list of questions to ask as a starting point for the meeting. In the needs assessment we also had a few things we needed the client to do before the next meeting, and a list of references for some research that we could do to learn more about the organization.

### Business Requirements
Our business plan was made to describe what the site would accomplish and what we needed to do to be able to meet the clients needs. We broke this up into a list of requirements:
* General
* Design
* Development
* Technical
* Client Training

This gives us a guide for what steps we need to take to complete the project.

The business requirements document can be viewed [here]({{ page.assets }}BusinessRequirements.pdf).

### Mockups and Prototype
For the next step we needed to come up with wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get the client to sign off on before development could start.

The client wanted a splash page with two main sections that split the site into the two different competitions. We came up with an idea of splitting the width of the page in half, one for each section. We did this because the client specifically instructed that the two competitions needed clear separation and distinction from each other.

One of our mockups was built on [this template](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/10/25/split-layout/) from codrops. This was the design inspiration for the final build.

### Deployment and Client Training
Finally it was time to deliver the final production site. Unfortunately do to NSCC regulations we weren't able to get hosting and permission to publish the site in time before the end of the school year, which wasn't a problem because the it was somewhat of a mock project for experience. However we were able to hand the completed site over to the client so if they ever did get permission sorted out with the school they would be able to deploy the site.

Another one of the final requirements of completing the project was meeting with the client to show them the final build and to train them. The client needed to be shown things like how to log into the back end, update contact info, and update image slideshows. We also created a training document for the client to reference after the training.
