One of my projects in school was to work in a team with a client to build a site based on the clients needs. The assignment took place over the course of a semester and it was graded more on documentation and teamwork rather than the actual site itself. The goal was to work closely with the client to be able to meet their needs, while documenting our requirements and development process.

Throughout the course of the semester we would have to meet with our professor
