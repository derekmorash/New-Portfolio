  <p>I started working at Team Clinton in April of 2015 when school ended. It started as a six week intership/work term that I was doing for school, but after the six weeks I was hired as a full-time employee.</p>

  <p>This concentration focuses on building your programming skills to form a solid foundation in current and emerging web-based technologies. You develop skills and knowledge in web application development, user-interface design and usability, web server administration and security, and mobile application development. Plus, you learn to combine these skills to create effective solutions.</p>
